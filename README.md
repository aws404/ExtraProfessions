# Extra Professions Mod
Add extra professions to villages, including workstations and village buildings. 

## Added Professions
### Lumberjack
The lumberjack manages the new lumber farm buildings, **chopping down trees** and **planting new ones** in their place or on spare **podzol** blocks.  
Its workstation is the **sawmill** block, which also adds a new way of **crafting wood products**, sometimes at a reduced material cost.
They will also trade a variety ofs wooden products with you, depending on their surroundings.
